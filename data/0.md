Define L1 and L2 losses


%%%solution%%%

$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$
$y \in \mathbb{R}^n$

$l1(x,y) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n{|x_i - y_i|}$

$l2(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n{(x_i - y_i)^2}}$

%%%question%%%

When to choose l1 over l2?

%%%solution%%%

l1 does feature selection and is robust to outliers.

l2 is differentiable, and is more robust to codependency i.e. less variance on estimates.
